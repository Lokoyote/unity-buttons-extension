## 🚀 Overview
This extension cleans up your workspace and maximizes your screen real estate by integrating window controls and the application title directly into the top panel. 

It is designed for users of **Ubuntu 24.04** and **Fedora** looking to recapture the productivity of the classic Unity desktop with modern GNOME Shell performance.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Smart Visibility**: Buttons and title appear in the top bar **only** when the current window is maximized.
* **Auto-Decoration Toggle**: Automatically hides native window buttons when maximized and restores them instantly when the window is unmaximized (restored).
* **Unity Aesthetic**: Features sleek, circular buttons for Closing and Unmaximizing, following the iconic Unity layout.
* **Dynamic Title**: Displays the focused window's title next to the controls for quick identification.
* **Clean Integration**: No bulky hover effects on the panel; only the buttons themselves are interactive, maintaining a native and minimalist look.
* **Desktop Friendly**: Intelligent filtering to avoid showing "Desktop Icons" as a window title.
